## Background.
Hosted by Hertie Coding Club, the SQL Workshop aims for introducing basic SQL to the student.  
With R and Python, SQL is also one of the most important programming languages in data relevant fields (data scientist, data analytics). Therefore, we decided to hold this workshop. 

## Session 
The workshop consists of two sessions. The first is **basic SQL**, and the second is **Advanced SQL**.

### Preparation 
Originally, for learning SQL, installing DataBase Management System (DBMS) is preferable. But it takes too long and the file size is also too large. So, for a smooth workshop, we will use **R programming** together. That is, this workshop is based on **SQL** and **R**. Therefore, installing R studio is necessary.

### Session 1 

`SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP BY`

1. SELECT * FROM {table name}
2. SELECT * FROM {table name} WHERE {condition}
3. SELECT * FROM {table name} WHERE {condition} GROUP BY {criterion}


### Session 2

1. Subquery
